# Lab 4: Redux Platform Frontend

*I am doing Diversity, a platform where you can catalog the species you find when you go scuba diving!*

You can check out the Diversity page [here](https://diversity.onrender.com)

## What Worked Well
- It was great to learn how to make something using the CRUD functionality. There are so many possibilities of what you can do with it. I feel like my coding skills are really improving!

## What Didn't
- I found it very hard to use bootstrapping and spent too much time investigating different bootstraps and how to make them fit my code. For future assignemnts, it would be helpful to have some curated examples on how to implement them into our code, and deal with styling conflicts.

## Extra Credit
- Input validation: doesn't let the user create a new post or update an existing one unless all fields have values. It also checks for valid image inputs (gif,png,jpeg,jpg).
- I was trying to implement an API to get latitude and longitude from the city (tags) and display them in the map, but since we have a limited data strucutre now, it became too complex. I will fully implement this next lab.
- Styling: added video background to welcoming page

## Notes:
- The styling of the page was inspired from the several sources listed above. Throughout this project, I worked with my classmates Tyler Neath, Marco Cabrera, and Will McCall. We discussed algorithms, general data parsing, shared online resources with each other, and each one of us implemented their own app.
